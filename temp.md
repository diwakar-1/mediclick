INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama17b API : The encoders in the pictures appear to be a part of a transformer model, which is a type of neural network architecture. The encoder consists of several layers, including:

*   **Multi-Head Attention**: This layer allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance.
*   **Feed Forward**: This layer is a fully connected feed-forward network that transforms the output from the multi-head attention layer.
*   **Add & Norm**: This layer adds the output from the previous layer to the input and normalizes the result.

These layers are repeated multiple times to form the encoder. The encoder takes in a sequence of tokens (such as words or characters) and outputs a sequence of vectors that represent the input sequence.

In this image, there are N encoders.
